# Where-s-my-jewelry-game
This game is programmed in Python using the Pygame library. It tells the story of a spoiled girl who loves jewelry, dolls, and hedgehogs. One night, she dreams that her favorite hedgehog toy steals her jewelry and hides it around the house. Currently, only the bedroom part of the game is implemented.
