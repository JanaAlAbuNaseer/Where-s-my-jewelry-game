# Where-s-my-jewelry-game
This is a game that was programmed using the Python language, specifically using the Pygame library. This game is about a spoiled girl who loves jewelry and dolls and she loved hedgehogs. One day she went to sleep and started dreaming that her favorite hedgehog toy stole her jewelry and hid it in different places in her room and the house, but the part that has been programmed so far is only her room.
